    nd now the end is here
    And so I face that final curtain
    My friend I'll make it clear
    <br><br><br>I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">
      I've lived a life that's full</a>
    I traveled each and every highway
    And more, much more
    I did itt사진과 같은 것을 어떻게 이어지는가> way
    Regrets, I've had a few
    But then again too few to mention
    I did what I had to do
    <img src="coing.jpeg" width="60%">
    I saw it through without exemption
    I planned each charted course
    Each careful step along the byway
    And more, much, much more
    I did it, I did it my way</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
    Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
    When I bit off more than I could chew
    But through it all, when there was doubt
    I ate it up and spit it out
    I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
    For what is a man, what has he got?
    If not himself then he has naught
    Not to say the things that he truly feels
    And not the words of someone who kneels
    Let the record shows I took all the blows and did it my way
